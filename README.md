# My Personal Website

**Status**: In progress

This is the repo used for my new personal website. My goal here is to create an interactive website that differentiates itself from the typical developer portfolio and, at the same time be, it allows me to play with edge technologies.

The technologies used so far are Gatsby, Contentful, Typescript, Tailwind, Emotion, among others. I want to add libraries like Three.js and GSAP to add interactivity, but that will depend on the site performance.

Any comments or questions? please tweet me at [@dnlnav](https://ctt.ac/pOd7c)
